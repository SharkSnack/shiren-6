# Overview

Stealing is where you take merchandise from a dungeon shop without paying for said merchandise.<br/>Shopkeepers and guards only chase you on the current floor, so you're golden once you reach the stairs.

### Dungeon Shop Basics

- The player cannot write on Blank Scrolls that have a price tag.
    - Don't sell your Blank Scroll if you plan on stealing by writing Wall-less Scroll on it.
- The player cannot give an Identifier Scroll to the Shopkeeper to identify merchandise.
    - This was a feature in Shiren 5, but it's not in this game.
- Traps cannot be generated on carpet tiles.
    - Pitfall Traps will not appear on the ground if you break a Bottomless Pot inside a shop.
    - Karakuroid will not create traps inside a shop.
- Wall-less Scroll transforms the entire floor into a shop, and Shopkeepers warp next to the stairs.
    - Shopkeepers will not head towards Wishing Shrines.
- Thief Mode triggers include:
    - Leaving the shop with unpaid-for merchandise, even when there are no Shopkeepers.
    - Using a Water Gun Pot on merchandise (weapon, scroll, or food) from outside the shop.
- Shopkeepers becoming hostile (prior to stealing):
    - Switching Staff <span class="blueText">will not</span> anger a Shopkeeper.
    - Eating a Sweet Potato <span class="blueText">will not</span> anger a Shopkeeper.
    - Dealing knockback to an enemy who bumps into a Shopkeeper <span class="blueText">will not</span> anger the Shopkeeper.
    - Hostile Shopkeepers will stop being angry if you revive using Revival Grass.
    - Attacking a Guard Dog or using a Narrow-escape Staff <span class="redText">will</span> anger a Shopkeeper.
- Shopkeepers <span class="blueText">are not</span> cured of bad status conditions when Thief Mode is triggered.
- It's possible to expand a shop by destroying surrounding wall tiles.

### Anti-Theft Measures

- Shops with 4\~5 Shopkeepers instead of the usual single Shopkeeper.
    - Each Shopkeeper will block an exit if possible when merchandise is picked up.
    - All Shopkeepers will become hostile if you do something to anger one of them.
- Shops with a Guard Dog.
    - The Guard Dog prevents Thiefwalrus from stealing an item when a Walrus Pot is used.
    - Walrus Pot can be used to steal after the Guard Dog has been dealt with.
- Shops surrounded by unbreakable wall tiles.
    - The player cannot enter these wall tiles even with a Wallpass Bracelet equipped.
- Shopkeeper with a Shield of Negation equipped.
    - Immune to magic bullets from swinging a staff, but scrolls and thrown staves are effective.
    - Inflicting Sealed status removes their ability to negate magic bullets.
- Shop without an entrance.
    - The shop is buried in wall tiles without an entrance, and a Spring Trap is present.

### Shopkeepers & Guards

- Disguising Staff and Peach Staff do not work, and all shop NPCs ignore Sanctuary Scroll.
- Shopkeeper
    - Normal speed, but changes to Swift 1 action speed when Thief Mode is triggered.
    - Stats (Red) = 180 HP / 180 Attack / 50 Defense
    - Stats (Blue) = 190 HP / 190 Attack / 70 Defense
    - Stats (Yellow) = 200 HP / 200 Attack / 90 Defense - Immune to staff magic
    - Stats (Black) = 210 HP / 210 Attack / 110 Defense
- Guard Dog
    - Swift 2 action speed at all times.
    - When present in a shop, it prevents theft using a Walrus Pot from outside the shop.
    - Continuously spawns during Thief Mode, and detects Shiren's position within 20 tiles.
    - Stats = 220 HP / 220 Attack / 220 Defense
- Shop Guard
    - Normal speed.
    - Up to 4 Shop Guards are generated surrounding the stairs when Thief Mode is triggered.
    - Continuously spawns during Thief Mode, and has a regular 1 tile range of detection.
    - Stats = 300 HP / 250 Attack / 250 Defense

### Thief Mode

- Shopkeepers change to Swift 1 action speed.
- Up to 4 Shop Guards are generated surrounding the stairs.
    - These Shop Guards don't attack on the turn they're generated.
    - Shop Guards don't surround Byways (blue stairs) or Wishing Shrines.
- 11 other Guard Dogs and Shop Guards are generated throughout the floor.
- Regular monsters stop spawning, and 1 Guard Dog or Shop Guard spawns every 16 turns.
    - Unlike Shiren 5, regular monsters already present do not transform into shop NPCs.
- Escape Scroll is nullified if read during Thief Mode.

# Risk vs. Return

Think carefully and weigh the pros and cons before you steal from a dungeon shop.<br/>If you have enough Gitan to buy the items you want, it might be best to simply purchase the items.<br/>This is especially true if you don't have a Monster-find Bracelet or Mapping Scroll on hand.

That said, selling your inventory and stealing it back can secure funds for future shopping.<br/>An expensive Sacred Item that nearly guarantees a successful adventure would be worth the risk, too.

# Methods

### Wall-less Scroll

The listed methods are follow-up actions after reading a Wall-less Scroll.

#### Knockback Staff / Switching Staff

Staves that simply move the Shopkeeper so they're no longer blocking the stairs.<br/>Narrow-escape Staff also works if used on a monster before the Shopkeeper (before Wall-less Scroll).

#### Paralyzing Staff / Disguising Staff

Throw an item at the Shopkeeper to anger them, then paralyze them when they're not on the stairs.<br/>Alternatively, swing a Disguising Staff at a regular monster, then anger the Shopkeeper.<br/>â€» Keep in mind that Shopkeepers themselves are immune to Disguising Staff.

#### Swift Grass / Invincible Grass / Earthmound Staff / Sluggish Staff

Anger the Shopkeeper, then use good movement to reach the stairs while the Shopkeeper chases you.<br/>The Shopkeeper won't gain Swift 1 speed since Thief Mode doesn't get triggered.

#### Peach Bun

Throw a Peach Bun at the Shopkeeper to transform them into a regular monster.<br/>This method is effective even on yellow Shopkeepers.

#### Monster as a wall

Anger the Shopkeeper, then circle around a regular monster using diagonal movement.<br/>Choose a weak monster since you're going to receive a decent number of attacks.

### Other Methods

<p><b><u>Methods to reach the stairs room:</u></b></p>

#### Wall Dig + Vaulting Staff / Switching Staff

Dig walls so that there's a straight path to the stairs from inside the shop, then land on the stairs.<br/>Monster-find Bracelet or Mapping Scroll ensures that no other monster is in the line of sight.<br/>Vaulting Staff - Use an Earthmound Staff or paralyzed monster to create a wall if needed.<br/>Switching Staff - Swing it at a monster who is standing directly on the stairs.

#### Expand the Shop

If the stairs room is next to the shop, dig walls so that you can enter the stairs room by taking 1 step.<br/>You'll still need to deal with the Shop Guards that get generated in the stairs room.

#### Reflective Incense + Narrow-escape Staff + Revival Grass / Starvation

Light a Reflective Incense, then swing a Narrow-escape Staff to warp yourself to the stairs.<br/>The Shop Guards will attack you while you're paralyzed, so Revival Grass or Starving status is needed.<br/>(Invincible Grass might work as well, but I haven't tested it yet)

#### Barricade (Earthmound Staff / Paralyzing Staff)

The idea is to block off the path to the stairs room beforehand so that Guard Dogs can't enter it.<br/>Don't use Paralyzing Staff on floors where Okame Monks appear, since they'll cure the status.<br/>You'll still need to deal with the Shop Guards that get generated in the stairs room.

#### Sumo Status (Dig Trap Rooms)

Dig small rooms where enemies get trapped due to their simple AI, buying time to reach the stairs.<br/>Enemies have a tendency to walk straight until they bump into a wall or creature in this game,<br/>so shop enemies other than Guard Dogs have a hard time escaping these small rooms.

Example:

<div class="relativeImage">
  <img src="../images/other/trap_rooms.png"/>
</div>

<p><b><u>Methods to deal with guards in the stairs room:</u></b></p>

#### Sweet Potato

All enemies in the same room as Shiren warp to a different location on the current floor.

#### Slumber Scroll + Switching Staff

Slumber Scroll is safer than Confusion Scroll since getting hit once will likely make you collapse.<br/>The Shop Guards will gain increased action speed if you don't reach the stairs within 12 turns.

#### Invincible Grass + Passerby Bracelet

The player can perform 19 actions without taking damage after eating an Invincible Grass,<br/>and Passerby Bracelet lets you swap places with adjacent enemies similar to friendly NPCs.<br/>If the stairs is far away, use Vaulting Staff or such to cover more distance in fewer turns.

<p><b><u>Other Methods:</u></b></p>

#### Bottomless Pot

Break the Bottomless Pot in a hallway outside of the shop, then step on the trap to advance floors.<br/><span class="redText">This only works in dungeons that have descending stairs, and doesn't work with Sumo status.</span>

#### Brute Force

Not recommended, and only viable in dungeons that allow carry-in items like Isle of the Mighty.<br/>You'll want a fully upgraded weapon + Wallpass Bracelet + Monster-find Bracelet at minimum,<br/>along with Sumo status and the Healing weapon rune to heal HP while you're inside walls.<br/>Bring lots of Revival Grass and maybe a Bottomless Pot in case things don't work out.
