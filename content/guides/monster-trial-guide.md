# Overview

Monster Trial is a [Sacred Tree](/system/sacred-tree) mode where the player challenges a selected dungeon as a monster.<br/>Playable monsters can be unlocked by clearing Dojo Challenges inside the [Monster Dojo](/system/monster-dojo).<br/>Some monsters can breeze through dungeons, while others might feel nearly impossible.

The player can use the monster's ability anytime (unless Sealed), similar to eating a Peach Bun.<br/>Likewise, some traps affect the player differently when playing as a monster.

However, there are also a number of significant changes to mechanics in this mode, such as:

- The player begins with the base stats of the selected monster.
- HP doesn't regenerate as turns elapse, but is restored to max every time you level up.
- Fullness doesn't deplete as turns elapse, but depletes by 4 every time you level up.
- Items cannot be used, but instead can be eaten to replenish 2 fullness.

#### Unavailable Dungeons

- Training Path of Extra Inference
- Peach Dungeon
- Trapper's Secret Path
- Heart of Serpentcoil Island (The 12 Celestial Stones)

#### Unavailable Monsters

- Golden Egg Thing
- Bosses
- Shop NPCs

# Mechanics

- You can freely use the monster's special attack and abilities, similar to eating a Peach Bun.
    - The player's starting stats = monster's base stats.
    - In some cases, stepping on a trap affects the monster differently than Shiren.
- Fullness doesn't deplete as turns elapse, and HP doesn't regenerate either.
    - Aquatic type monsters can stand on a water tile to restore their HP.
    - Ghost Samurai restores its HP when it possesses another monster.
- Player level increases by 1 each time you defeat a monster.
    - HP is fully restored upon leveling up, and fullness decreases by 4.
    - HP is fully restored upon leveling up even if fullness is currently 0.
    - The amount of max HP you gain is based on level.
        - Lv2\~19 = +1 HP, Lv20\~49 = +2 HP, Lv50\~99 = +3 HP.
    - Attack Power increases as you level up, but it's unknown if Defense increases.
        - The damage formula appears to be different than Shiren at first glance.
    - Once you reach Lv99, you can no longer level up and fully restore your HP.
        - Monsters who can restore HP on their own have an advantage for deeper dungeons.
- Items cannot be used - They can be eaten to replenish 2 fullness instead.
    - Eating to replenish 2 fullness applies to all item categories, including food items.
    - Monsters that generate new items like Bowboy can replenish fullness whenever they want.
    - Gitan cannot be eaten unless it's cursed.
    - Enemy Lv2\~4 Bored Kappas can be used to get hit by a thrown item if desired.
    - Exceptions:
        - Revival Grass - Still activates when carried in your inventory.
        - Sanctuary Scroll - Can be placed on the ground and used like normal.
        - Balance Staff - Prevents you from being tripped when carried in your inventory.
        - Incense - Can be activated by a Lv2\~4 Bored Kappa or Pot Knave.
        - Traps - Can be brought into the dungeon if the dungeon allows bringing items.
- Monsters who can pass through walls will still lose HP while inside a wall.
- The player cannot talk to NPCs like Travel Companions or Peddlers.
    - Fluffy Bunny Pup can still appear and fully restore your HP.
- Shops are never generated during a Monster Trial, even in Training Path of Shopping.
- Getting hit by a Peach Staff makes you instantly collapse.
    - Revival Grass can revive you if this happens.

# Basic Strategy

- HP can only be restored by leveling up, and once you reach Lv99, you can't restore HP.
    - Exceptions = Fluffy Bunny, Ghost Samurai, Masked Samurai family, Aquatic type monsters.
    - Consider waiting to eat an item until after you're done grinding levels when fullness is at 0.
- You generally want to rush to the stairs, and only defeat a necessary number of monsters.
    - Many playable monsters have useful special attacks or abilities, so use them!
    - Avoid Monster Houses when possible to prevent excessive level ups and fullness depletion.
- Some monsters like King Reaper are simply more viable than others like Chow.
    - Equipment and Eradication Scrolls can't be used, so Heart of Serpentcoil Island is quite hard.
    - A realistic goal for weaker monsters will likely be to just reach a specific floor.
- Generally speaking, level 4 monsters offer an advantage over level 1\~3 monsters.
    - However, there are exceptions like choosing Sleep Radish (Lv3) instead of Frenzy Radish (Lv4).
