#### Overview

Dojo Challenge is a feature that was added in the version 1.1.0 update.<br/>It's unlocked after clearing [Serpentcoil Island](/dungeons/serpentcoil-island), and lets you challenge dojos of monsters you've seen before.<br/>Each Dojo Challenge is basically a self-contained puzzle of sorts, similar to Fay's Puzzles in Shiren 1.<br/>However, unlike Fay's Puzzles, attack accuracy and enemy actions involve RNG like normal dungeons,<br/>so you might need to retry the challenge for more favorable outcomes in areas that involve luck.

#### Rewards

Clearing a dojo unlocks the corresponding monster family for play in [Sacred Tree](/system/sacred-tree) dungeons.<br/>An [achievement](/system/achievements) and a new Monster Dojo menu background is also unlocked upon clearing all 51 dojos.

#### Solutions
