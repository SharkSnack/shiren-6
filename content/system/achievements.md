# Overview

Clear Icons and Achievements are automatically attained as you reach certain milestones.

#### Which to Skip?

The game has a total of 51 achievements, and the final reward is obtained at 50 achievements.<br/>Therefore, if a player is only interested in the final reward, 1 achievement can be skipped.

Most players aiming for 50 achievements will likely end up skipping "Weapon Collector",<br/>since obtaining Accurate Sword requires clearing Heart of Serpentcoil Island 6 times.<br/>※ This game doesn't require a NSO subscription to use online features.
