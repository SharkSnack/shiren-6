# Overview

The Sacred Tree is a feature that was added in the version 1.1.0 update.<br/>It's unlocked after clearing [Serpentcoil Island](/dungeons/serpentcoil-island), and lets you challenge dungeons under special rules.

Notes:

- Villages and overworld areas are skipped.
- The player cannot request any rescues - Be very careful if you bring items!
- Monster slots you encounter inside a dungeon will get recorded in the Adventure Log like normal.
- Bosses are present in Serpentcoil Island, Dune of Batsu, Cavern of Suiryu, and Yamakagashi Pass.
- Press in the right analog stick to pause gameplay, including counters for Countdown Trial and such.

# Player Select

Sacred Tree dungeons offer an option to play as characters other than Shiren.

### Shiren

Can be used in all dungeons.

### Kokatsu Shiren

Unlocked by clearing [Cavern of Suiryu](/dungeons/cavern-of-suiryu)?<br/>Cannot be used in Peach Dungeon or Trapper's Secret Path.

#### Normal Attack

Shiren's normal attack initially reaches 1 tile ahead, but gains 1 tile of range per enemy defeated (max: 3 tiles).<br/>However, the boosted normal attack range resets to the initial state whenever Shiren receives damage.<br/>Since Shiren can't equip a shield, it's very important to utilize the extended range to avoid damage.<br/>This normal attack can cut through corners, and can also hit Pumphantasms inside walls.

#### Special Attacks

|-|-|-|
|Sand-handling|10|Creates a pillar of sand in front of you.<br/>If the tile in front is a wall, digs out the wall tile.|
