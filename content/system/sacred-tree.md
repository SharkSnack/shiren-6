### Asuka

<div class="characterImage">
  <img src="../images/other/char_asuka.png"/>
</div>

<p><span class="highlightOrange2">Description:</span> [Content]<br/><span class="highlightPurple">Unlock Condition:</span> Go through Peach Bun events and have Asuka join as an ally → Visit Sacred Tree.</p>

#### Restrictions

- <span class="highlightGreen">Dungeons:</span> None.
- <span class="highlightYellow">Item Categories:</span> None.

#### Characteristics

- Normal Attack (No Runes) = Reaches 1 tile ahead, deals damage, 15% critical hit rate.
    - Asuka's critical hits deal x3.0 damage, crit chance boosting runes are additive.
        - Damage for guaranteed critical hit sources like Jagged Sword is possibly halved.
    - Damage increases primarily based on level, strength, equipped weapon, and other effects.
        - Other effects include runes (ex: Anti-Dragon) and status conditions (ex: Empowered, Damage-up).
    - Asuka deals more damage with weapons than Shiren \~ Rough damage calculation:
        - (WEP_ATK + STR_ATK + LV_ATK) - [ENEMY_DEF x 0.5] + 1 x RNG (87.5 ~ 112.5%)
            - WEP_ATK = [AP x 0.9768866551] + [AP x Strength x 0.0406122449]
                - AP = Weapon's attack power
            - STR_ATK = Strength
            - LV_ATK:
                - Level &le; 4 = 0.5 + (Lv - 1) x 2
                - 5 &le; Level &le; 13 = 6.5 + (Lv - 4) x 1
                - 14 &le; Level = 15.5 + (Lv - 13) x 0.5
- Defense = Asuka has no innate defense, and increasing level or strength does nothing for defense.
    - Damage received decreases primarily based on equipped shield and other effects.
        - Other effects include runes (ex: Costly Block) and status conditions (ex: Fortified, Damage-down).
    - Asuka's damage reduction based on shield strength is weaker than Shiren's:
        - Asuka:
            - Shield defense &le; 40 = Reduce damage by <span class="redText">0.5</span> per point of defense less than or equal to <span class="redText">40</span>.
            - Shield defense > 40 = Reduce damage by <span class="redText">0.3</span> per point of defense above <span class="redText">40</span>.
        - Shiren:
            - Shield defense &le; 20 = Reduce damage by <span class="blueText">1.0</span> per point of defense less than or equal to <span class="blueText">20</span>.
            - Shield defense > 20 = Reduce damage by <span class="blueText">0.6</span> per point of defense above <span class="blueText">20</span>.
