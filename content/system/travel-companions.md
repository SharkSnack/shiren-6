# Basics

- Companions can only be recruited inside a dungeon in Shiren 6.
    - To be clear, you can't ask them to join you before heading out.
- Companions can appear in the following dungeons:
    - Serpentcoil Island
    - Ghost Ship
    - Dune of Batsu
    - Training Path of Gimmicks
    - Training Path of Shopping
    - Kiki Island
    - Yamakagashi Pass (Version 1.1.0+)
    - Sacred Ocean Tunnel (Version 1.1.0+)
    - Peach Dungeon (Version 1.1.0+)
    - Wanderers' Highway (Version 2.0.0+)
    - Wild Monster Path  (Version 2.0.0+)
    - Battleground of the Rivals (Version 2.0.0+)
    - Certain Sacred Tree Mode extensions like Isle of the Mighty (Version 1.2.0+)
- Companions who join in the middle of Serpentcoil Island cannot be taken to other dungeons.
    - However, they can be taken to hidden routes like Secluded Path.
- Companions follow you to the next floor even if they weren't near you when you advance floors.
- The player can have up to 3 companions following them at any given time.
    - It's possible to remove companions from your party using a menu option.
- Experience points do not get reduced based on party size.
    - It doesn't matter who defeated the monster, everyone earns the full amount of experience points.
- A companion character's level resets after the current adventure ends.
    - Unlike Shiren 5, there's no point to leveling them up in terms of meta-progression.
- Starting level can vary depending on the dungeon or floor where you recruited the companion.
- Companions who have an ability will decide on their own whether or not to use the ability.
    - The player cannot make them use their ability by talking to them.
- A companion character's HP is displayed in the upper right side of the screen.
    - Unlike Shiren, exact HP values are not displayed.
    - Companions regenerate HP as turns elapse, except for when they attack.
- The player can strengthen or heal a companion by throwing an item at them.
    - Power-up Grass, Invincible Grass, or Swift Grass behaves as you'd expect.
    - Herb, Otogirisou, Healing Grass, Life Grass, and Rejuvenation Pot (1+ capacity) <span class="blueText">does</span> restore HP.
        - Max HP does not increase when the companion's HP is already at max.
    - Revival Grass, Grilled Onigiri, and Fixer Scroll <span class="redText">does not</span> restore HP.
- Companions don't get reduced attack power when afflicted with Onigiri status.
    - However, they can't use their ability, and Asuka will lose the effects of equipped items.
- Companions will retreat when their HP gets very low (20\~30% HP remaining?).
    - Stronger monsters can hit for 50%+ of a companion's HP, so you'll still want to protect them.
- The HP bar can act somewhat glitchy when a companion's Max HP exceeds 190 or so.
    - This mostly only occurs when Asuka has equipment with Max HP increasing runes.
- Items like Windblade Scroll and Confusion Scroll don't affect companions.
    - However, Sweet Potato and Gassy Trap will make companions warp.
- Talking to a companion character doesn't end your turn.
- Companions sometimes move in a way to stay at Shiren's side instead of following behind him.
    - They also avoid monsters that aren't an immediate threat, such as Napping or Paralyzed ones.
- Companions aside from Asuka seem to always dodge thrown weapons, shields, and bracelets.
    - This includes equipment disarmed by a Swordsman family monster.
- Switching places with a companion only ends Shiren's turn - The companion can still act.
- If Shiren is morphed as a Nigiri Morph monster and uses its ability on a companion, they collapse.
- Repeatedly switching places is a reliable method to safely wait out companions with Confused status.

# Extra Notes

### Morphed Status

- Throw a Peach Bun at a companion to have them morph into an ally monster.
    - Skull Wizard's magic can also morph a companion into a monster.
- HP is restored when a companion morphs into a monster, and they can use the monster's ability.
- The morphed companion's stats seem to scale based on the monster's stats.
- Morphed status lasts for the duration of the current floor for companions.
    - Disguising Staff can be used to revert a companion back to their normal self.

### Switching Places

- Switching places with a companion only ends the player's turn, so the companion can still act.

### Turn Order

Actions generally take place in the following order:

1. Player Turn
2. Companion Turn
3. Enemy Turn

However, if a companion doesn't act during their turn, they can react after enemies instead:

1. Player Turn
2. Companion Turn (do nothing)
3. Enemy Turn
4. Companion Turn (react to enemies)

This reaction turn can be used to have a companion attack an enemy 2 times before being hit.

### Double Attack Trick

This section explains how to maneuver a companion so that they get 2 attacks in against an enemy.

#### Basic Method

Step in place when an enemy is 1 tile away so that the enemy becomes adjacent to the companion.<br/>※ Best with Asuka, Tugai, and Seki, since Hibiki and Porky have ranged special attacks.

Example Layout:

<pre>
  ■ □ □ E □ ■<br/>
  ■ □ □ □ □ ■<br/>
  ■ □ P C □ ■
</pre>

Turn 1:

1. Player → Step in place.
2. Companion → No action.
3. Enemy → Approaches, now adjacent to companion.
4. Companion → Reacts to the enemy by attacking it.

Turn 2:

1. Player → Does whatever.
2. Companion → Attacks the enemy.
3. Enemy → Does whatever.

#### Switch Method

Technique that can be used when an enemy is approaching with a companion following directly behind you.<br/>※ Effective in hallways when the floor's field of view is not limited by fog or darkness.

Example Layout:

<pre>
  ■ ■ ■ ■<br/>
  E □ P C<br/>
  ■ ■ ■ ■
</pre>

Turn 1:

1. Player → Switch places with companion.
2. Companion → No action.
3. Enemy → Approaches, now adjacent to companion.
4. Companion → Reacts to the enemy by attacking it.

Turn 2:

1. Player → Does whatever.
2. Companion → Attacks the enemy.
3. Enemy → Does whatever.

### Comparisons

#### Base Stats

Highest base stats seems to be in this order: Tugai / Hibiki &gt; Seki &gt; Asuka &gt; Porky.

- Tugai & Hibiki have the highest base attack power.
- Seki is 3rd in base attack power, but seems to deal 10\~20% less damage than the above 2 characters.
- Asuka has lower base attack power and defense, but can equip a weapon and shield.
- Porky has much lower HP on top of lower base attack power and defense.

#### Abilities

- Asuka - Equip a weapon and shield to boost stats + gain rune effects, safely identify equipment.
- Hibiki - High base stats, can heal Shiren or disable monsters from a distance.
- Porky - Deal 20 fixed damage per special attack usage, player can collect Porky's Rocks that miss.
- Tugai - High base stats, chance to land critical hits, sometimes tanks damage for the player.
- Seki - Swift action speed, retreats after attacking, evades enemy normal attacks more often.

#### Drawbacks

This list pretty much applies to all companions.

- A monster that defeats a companion will level up.
- Lower Max HP than the player, so they quickly collapse against power type monsters or Behemoths.
- Can get in the way of item duplication in Bouncy Wall Rooms, or other item/monster farming tricks.
- AI can be a bit unpredictable when 2 or more companions are following the player.
- They might attack the player when they have Blind or Confused status.
- The player is likely to defeat companions if they gain Berserk status.
- Harder to use items like Leaping Grass or Sweet Potato since companions will be on their own.
- Harder to steal from dungeon shops if you want companions to stay alive.
- Items consumed to protect companions can outpace items conserved by having companions.
    - If you feel this is the case, it might be time to part ways with your companions.
