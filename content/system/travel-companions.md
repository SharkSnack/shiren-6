# Basic Info

- Companions can only be recruited inside a dungeon in Shiren 6.
    - To be clear, you can't ask them to join you before heading out.
- Companions can appear in the following dungeons:
    - Serpentcoil Island
    - Ghost Ship
    - Dune of Batsu
    - Training Path of Gimmicks
    - Training Path of Shopping
    - Kiki Island
    - Yamakagashi Pass (Version 1.1.0+)
    - Sacred Ocean Tunnel (Version 1.1.0+)
- Companions who join in the middle of Serpentcoil Island cannot be taken to other dungeons.
    - However, they can be taken to hidden routes like Secluded Path.
- Companions follow you to the next floor even if they weren't near you when you advance floors.
- The player can have up to 3 companions following them at any given time.
    - It's possible to remove companions from your party using a menu option.
- Experience points do not get reduced based on party size.
    - It doesn't matter who defeated the monster, everyone earns the full amount of experience points.
- A companion character's level resets after the current adventure ends.
    - Unlike Shiren 5, there's no point to leveling them up in terms of meta-progression.
- Starting level can vary depending on the dungeon or floor where you recruited the companion.
- Companions who have an ability will decide on their own whether or not to use the ability.
    - The player cannot make them use their ability by talking to them.
- A companion character's HP is displayed in the upper right side of the screen.
    - Unlike Shiren, exact HP values are not displayed.
    - Companions regenerate HP as turns elapse, except for when they attack.
- The player can strengthen or heal a companion by throwing an item at them.
    - Power-up Grass, Invincible Grass, or Swift Grass behaves as you'd expect.
    - Herb, Otogirisou, Healing Grass, Life Grass, and Rejuvenation Pot (1+ capacity) <span class="blueText">does</span> restore HP.
        - Max HP does not increase when the companion's HP is already at max.
    - Revival Grass, Grilled Onigiri, and Fixer Scroll <span class="redText">does not</span> restore HP.
- Companions don't get reduced attack power when afflicted with Onigiri status.
    - However, they can't use their ability, and Asuka will lose the effects of equipped items.
- Companions will retreat when their HP gets very low (20\~30% HP remaining?).
    - Stronger monsters can hit for 50%+ of a companion's HP, so you'll still want to protect them.
- The HP bar can act somewhat glitchy when a companion's Max HP exceeds 190 or so.
    - This mostly only occurs when Asuka has equipment with Max HP increasing runes.
- Items like Windblade Scroll and Confusion Scroll don't affect companions.
    - However, Sweet Potato and Gassy Trap will make companions warp.
- Talking to a companion character doesn't end your turn.
- Companions sometimes move in a way to stay at Shiren's side instead of following behind him.
    - They also avoid monsters that aren't an immediate threat, such as Napping or Paralyzed ones.
- Companions aside from Asuka seem to always dodge thrown weapons, shields, and bracelets.
    - This includes equipment disarmed by a Swordsman family monster.
- Switching places with a companion only ends Shiren's turn - The companion can still act.
