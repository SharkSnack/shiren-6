# Overview

Parallel Play is a feature where a player can create a separate suspend point in a dungeon.<br/>Once created, the player can upload the data online for others to play, or play the data themselves.<br/>This Parallel Play feature is most often used as a way to host an event or challenge of some sort.<br/>Loading and playing a Parallel Play adventure does not impact your actual save file in any way,<br/>and it's possible to load your own Parallel Data to scout upcoming floors without risk.<br/><span class="redText">※ Most players consider loading your own Parallel Data mid-adventure to be cheating.</span><br/><span class="orangeText">※ This page was last edited on May 22nd, 2025.</span>

# Mechanics

- "Parallel Play in progress..." is displayed on screen during a Parallel Play adventure.
- The player can create new Parallel Data during a Parallel Play adventure.
- Uploaded Parallel Data displays the following information:
    - Dungeon name, Floor, Player stats, Parallel ID, Download Period, Creator
- Only 1 Parallel Data can be uploaded at a time.
    - If you upload new Parallel Data, the previously uploaded data will be deleted.
- Parallel Data is region-locked based on language settings.
    - Example: Japanese Parallel Data IDs cannot be used in the English version of the game.
- Up to 10 Parallel Data can be uploaded online per day.
    - You can create new Parallel Data for offline use an unlimited number of times.
- The Parallel Data is assigned an expiration date when uploaded by a regular player.
    - Parallel Data uploaded by Spike Chunsoft does not have an expiration date.
- Up to 5 Parallel Data can be saved at any given time.
- Parallel Data cannot be created in the following areas:
    - Secluded Path, Ghost Ship, Golden Highway, Tunnel of Wishes
- Once Parallel Data is created, you can restart from that point an unlimited number of times.
    - The data does not get automatically deleted even if you collapse or clear the dungeon.
- The player cannot take any items or Gitan to their save file upon clearing a Parallel Data.
    - Inserting an item into a Warehouse Pot simply makes the item fall underfoot.
