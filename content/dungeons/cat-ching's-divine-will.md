Post-game dungeon where both the player and monsters can be ensnared by traps.<br/>Unlike [Trapper's Secret Path](/dungeons/trapper's-secret-path), the player doesn't have a Trapper's Bracelet, so traps can't be relocated.<br/>The player also doesn't earn any experience points when a monster steps on or is defeated by a trap.<br/>Overall, it looks like a trap dungeon at first glance, but it's mostly about throwing Gitan bags.

# Strategy

### General

#### Main Strategy

Weapons and shields on the ground are low quality, and staves and scrolls can't be found.<br/>Instead, most items that get generated are Gitan bags ranging in value from 100\~1000+ Gitan,<br/>with earlier floors usually generating higher value Gitan bags compared to deeper floors.<br/>So the idea is to stock up on Gitan bags at the start, then rush stairs until you clear the dungeon,<br/>utilizing traps to conserve the number of Gitan bags you throw when possible.

#### How to add Gitan to your inventory

1. Hold B and move towards the Gitan bag to step on the Gitan bag without picking it up.
2. Open your inventory, then exchange an item with the Gitan bag underfoot.

#### Firepuff (1-3F)

Firepuff is a Dragon and <b>Floating</b> dual-type monster, so it can't be ensnared by traps.<br/>Its special attack deals a fixed 10 damage, so it can be quite a problem when Shiren is at Lv1.<br/>It's somewhat common to have to restart until you get an opening where there's a Gitan bag nearby,<br/>which can be thrown at Firepuff to instantly defeat it.

### Trap Info

It's important to utilize traps when possible to conserve Gitan bags.

#### Spinning Trap / Sleep Trap / Blinding Trap / Sluggish Trap / Delusion Trap / Onigiri Trap

<div class="relativeImage pageLinksTable">
  <img src="../images/traps/11.png"/> <img src="../images/traps/12.png"/> <img src="../images/traps/14.png"/> <img src="../images/traps/18.png"/> <img src="../images/traps/15.png"/> <img src="../images/traps/16.png"/>
</div>

These are traps that inflict a negative stauts condition, with Delusion Trap being the most powerful.<br/>Monsters with Deluded status won't attack Shiren, and will instead run away from him forever.<br/>The second best trap is Blinding Trap, since its effect similarly never wears off for monsters.<br/>Sleep and Onigiri have short durations, so only use it against enemies you can defeat quickly.

#### Spring Trap

<div class="relativeImage pageLinksTable">
  <img src="../images/traps/8.png"/>
</div>

Step on this when you're being chased to warp to a different location on the current floor.<br/>Basically the same as Leaping Grass, except you can't carry the Spring Trap around.

#### Rotting Trap

<div class="relativeImage pageLinksTable">
  <img src="../images/traps/21.png"/>
</div>

Monsters who step on this trap are instantly defeated and transform into a Rotten Onigiri.<br/>Rotten Onigiri can be thrown at a monster to inflict them with a negative status condition.<br/>Blast Trap or Firepuff can be used to turn Rotten Onigiri into Grilled Onigiri.

#### Blast Trap / Explosion Trap

<div class="relativeImage pageLinksTable">
  <img src="../images/traps/6.png"/> <img src="../images/traps/7.png"/>
</div>

Any monsters caught in the blast that occurs will instantly collapse.<br/>So it's possible to step on it when a Floating type monster is adjacent to get rid of the monster.<br/>In this game, Shiren won't collapse even if his current HP is 1 when he steps on this trap.

#### Far-throwing Trap

<div class="relativeImage pageLinksTable">
  <img src="../images/traps/17.png"/>
</div>

Grants Far-throwing Status, which makes thrown items pierce through walls and creatures.<br/>Basically, stepping on this trap lets you throw Gitan against Hoppin' Hitter and Bored Kappa.<br/>Just be aware that you won't be able to recover thrown Gitan that misses its target.

#### Poison Arrow Trap / Wooden Arrow Trap

<div class="relativeImage pageLinksTable">
  <img src="../images/traps/3.png"/> <img src="../images/traps/2.png"/>
</div>

A single Poison Arrow reduces enemy attack power by about 50%.<br/>It can help you withstand more hits while running away, but Shiren's attack power is too low<br/>to keep up with stronger enemies later on either way, so don't bother collecting lots of arrows.<br/>Wooden Arrows mostly stop being useful after 4F or so.

#### Floor-exiting Trap

<div class="relativeImage pageLinksTable">
  <img src="../images/traps/29.png"/>
</div>

Step on this trap to instantly advance to the next floor.<br/>If you see it on the ground, it's best to hurry over to it before a monster steps on it.

#### Trap-setting Trap

<div class="relativeImage pageLinksTable">
  <img src="../images/traps/31.png"/>
</div>

Step on this to increase the number of traps on the ground.<br/>Shiren can see traps from the start, so there's no real downside to stepping on it.

#### Summoning Trap / Rage Trap

<div class="relativeImage pageLinksTable">
  <img src="../images/traps/24.png"/> <img src="../images/traps/26.png"/>
</div>

These 2 traps offer zero advantages for the player when activated.<br/>Try to avoid having monsters step on them if possible.

# Floor Guide

Hallways are visible on all floors, so make heavy use of the <span class="blueText">Look Around</span> command in rooms.<br/>Avoid dashing, since you can end up in a bad situation very quickly even with 1 tile gap enabled.<br/>The value of Gitan bags tends to be higher early on, but decreases as you descend deeper.

### 1-2F

Shagga (18 HP, 6 atk, 4 def) looks strong, but can be defeated easily if it's a 1 vs 1 fight.<br/>Firepuff (20 HP, 7 atk, 7 def) is the most dangerous enemy in this floor range, contrary to its cuteness.<br/>It takes \~4 hits for a Lv1 Shiren to defeat Firepuff, while Firepuff can deal 10 damage with its flame,<br/>so you'll need to either throw Gitan at it, or have Shiren step on a Blast Trap to one-shot it.<br/>If you need to run from a Firepuff, avoid entering longer hallways if possible.

Don't pick up Gitan normally - Step on it by holding B, then exchange it with an inventory item.<br/>This lets you carry the Gitan bag as an item, which can be thrown as a projectile.<br/>Staying at 0 Gitan also lets you hunt Froggos (23 HP, 10 atk, 13 def) for more Gitan bags and exp.<br/>When throwing Gitan, save the higher value bags for later floors instead of using them first.

Once you've leveled up a bit, lure Mamels and Shaggas onto a Rotting Trap to make Rotten Onigiri.<br/>Rotten Onigiri turns into HP restoring Grilled Onigiri when Shiren gets hit by Firepuff's flame.<br/>Firepuff always uses its special attack through hallway corners.

Collect some Poison Arrows if possible if you find a Poison Arrow Trap on the ground.<br/>Linger until the wind blows on 1\~2F to level up and stock up on Grilled Onigiri and Gitan bags.

### 3F

Cave Mamel (5 HP, 100 atk, 100 def) appears as a somewhat rare encounter on 3-4F.<br/>Normal attacks only deal 1 damage to Cave Mamel, but it can be instantly slain by throwing Gitan.<br/>Cave Mamel provides 2000 experience points, so it's best to hunt any that you encounter.

Soldier Ant (50 HP, 25 atk, 16 def) digs out wall tiles instead of chasing Shiren, so it's pretty harmless.<br/>However, Soldier Ant will attack if you become adjacent to it - Same goes for Corporal Ant later on.

### 4-5F

Hoppin' Hitter (32 HP, 22 atk, 15 def) appears on 4-5F, and reflects or nullifies projectiles.<br/>The easiest counter is to step on a Far-throwing Trap to gain Far-throwing Status, then throw Gitan,<br/>since Hoppin' Hitter cannot reflect or nullify projectiles with piercing properties.

Zapdon (80 HP, 43 atk, 35 def) appears on 4-10F, and has slow speed but high defensive stats.<br/>It's best to ignore it since hitting it 3 times activates a 25 damage lightning counter attack.

Minotaur (70 HP, 31 atk, 20 def) and Metalhead (66 HP, 30 atk, 19 def) also appear on 5-10F.<br/>They both hit pretty hard, so try to deal with them from a distance before they're adjacent.<br/>Keep in mind that Metalhead can attack up to 2 tiles ahead.

### 6F

This is the only floor with a "Shuffle Dungeon" style map generation in this dungeon.<br/>The map is chosen from a group of predetermined patterns instead of being randomly generated.

New threats include Bored Kappa (50 HP, 18 atk, 11 def) and Master Hen (70 HP, 33 atk, 21 def).<br/>Bored Kappa is immune to projectiles that lack piercing properties, kind of like Hoppin' Hitter.<br/>Master Hen is a brawler style monster like Minotaur, but provides 400 experience points,<br/>so they're a nice target to hunt to level up if you weren't able to hunt a Cave Mamel earlier.<br/>They can be instantly defeated by throwing a Gitan bag with a value of 350 or more Gitan.

Gitan bags found on the ground will decrease in value to 300 or less from around this point.<br/>The final floor with Froggos is 7F, so combined with strong Dragon type monsters appearing soon,<br/>it's recommended to rush stairs to conserve Gitan starting from 7F or 8F.

### 7-10F

Lashagga (99 HP, 43 atk, 34 def) appears on 7-10F, and attacks 3 times per turn.<br/>Getting hit by its attacks nearly guarantees a collapse, so don't let it become adjacent.<br/>You'll need to throw a Gitan bag with a value of at least 500 Gitan to one-shot it.

Dragon (120 HP, 45 atk, 40 def) appears on 8-10F, and spews 20 damage fire in a straight line.<br/>Throwing a Gitan bag with a value of at least 600 Gitan will one-shot it.

8-10F often features water tiles, so flowing water and rafts can be generated on occasion.<br/>Avoid going against the flow of water if possible, and use the <span class="blueText">Look Around</span> command a lot.<br/>The goal is close, so take things one step at a time and do your best!
