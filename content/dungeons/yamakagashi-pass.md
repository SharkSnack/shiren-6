Post-game dungeon that's kind of like a bite-sized version of a classic unidentified items dungeon.<br/>All items besides incenses are found unidentified, and all floors except for 13F have dark hallways.<br/>In addition to a pretty relentless monster table, there's also a tougher boss fight waiting at the end.<br/>Overall, this dungeon has gained some notoriety online due to its difficulty for reasons listed below.<br/>If you're struggling to clear the dungeon, rest assured that you're definitely not alone.

# Strategy

### General

This dungeon is said to be difficult for the following reasons:

- Monsters like Curse Girl (65 HP, 28 atk, 28 def) that almost feel out-of-depth for when they appear.
    - Tough monsters continuously appearing like this makes it difficult to conserve resources.
- Mixers are not in the monster table, so you're unlikely to be able to upgrade equipment.
- Froggo, Thiefwalrus, and Mudkin are also missing, so you can't farm items or exp easily.
- The boss is generally challenging, so if you lack items, rushing stairs often just ensures a loss.
    - He can summon clones or ninja underlings and can leap away from the player.
- Despite the above, monsters constantly destroy items on the ground throughout the dungeon.
    - Fire Ninja D (5-9F), Field Knave (8-11F), Pot Knave (14-16F), Fire Ninja C (21-24F), etc.
- When the item destruction finally eases up, monsters can be too tough to check rooms.
- Monster Houses seem to have a higher chance of being generated than some other dungeons.
    - Special Monster Houses can also be generated here.

That said, the monster table does allow for some farming techniques on a few floor ranges.

- 1-3F - Nigiri Baby can be used to obtain lots of Large Onigiri.
- 7-9F - Collect arrows from Bowboy monsters using sand pillars built by Earth Ninja D.
- 6-12F - Have Karakuroid create Poison Arrow Traps, and collect Poison Arrows.

However, since these floor ranges are all early game, whether you can do them or not depends on luck.<br/>It becomes difficult to perform Nigiri Morph Factory if you don't find a decent shield at the start,<br/>and Karakuroid has 20 attack power so you'll have a hard time collecting Poison Arrows too.<br/>Most other floor ranges either destroy items or have tough enemies, making it pointless to explore.

Other notable things:

- The item table doesn't include many negative effect items, so it's fine to use items to ID them.
    - At worst, you might become afflicted with a status condition after eating a grass item.
- Wishing Shrines are on the common side, so you might get lucky with a good wish selection.

So overall, this dungeon emphasizes run-away play more than a standard style of gameplay.<br/>This is in contrast to Kiki Island, which is a more standard 25F unidentified items dungeon.

### Important Items

##### Wooden Arrows / Iron Arrows

Tougher monsters appear starting from 10F, so shoot arrows in hallway to avoid surprise attacks.<br/>Enemies who nullify projectiles like Fierous or Mixer don't appear, so it's an effective technique here.

##### Poison Arrows

A single Poison Arrow reduces a monster's Attack Power by 50%, making it feasible to trade hits.<br/>It's useful even when a monster is adjacent in a hallway since the damage reduction is so significant,<br/>and it can also be used against Karakuroid to make it easier to create more Poison Arrow Traps.<br/>In addition, Poison Arrows are effective against the boss, so collect as many as possible.

##### Monster-find Bracelet

Reveals the locations of monsters on the map, and lets you see incoming enemies in dark hallways.<br/>You'll be able to spot shops and Monster Houses at a glance while this is equipped.

##### Fixer Scroll

Fully restores HP and also solves one additional problem depending on your situation.<br/>It can be read when you're surrounded by 2 or more enemies to paralyze all adjacent enemies.<br/>Your shield is likely to get cursed by Curse Girl, but don't waste a Fixer Scroll to lift the curse,<br/>since Mixers don't appear and this scroll has far better uses like fully replenishing Fullness.

##### Sanctuary Scroll

The effect is nullified during boss fights, but it can be useful for a Monster House.<br/>Monsters with ranged attacks are on the uncommon side, but beware of Fire Ninja and Water Ninja.

##### Blank Scroll

If Eradication Scroll is recorded in your notebook from playing Domain of Staves and Scrolls,<br/>you can write Eradication on a Blank Scroll to banish a monster like Field Knave or Swordsman.<br/>If you also find a Cashing Pot, insert an Eradication Scroll to obtain a Gitan bag worth 4000 Gitan,<br/>which can be thrown at the boss to instantly defeat it.

##### Yamanba's Cleaver & Yamanba's Potlid

High base attack and defense, and Shiren gains strength when the equipment is cursed.<br/>There are plenty of Curse Girl family monsters in this dungeon, so it's easy to activate the rune.<br/>Despite the confusing in-game description, the item is not always cursed when generated.

##### Ferrous Greatsword & Ferrous Kite

Boosts damage dealt by x1.5, and reduces damage received by 30%.<br/>However, the -2 Fullness per hit cost is a bit high for general use, so save it for the boss.

##### Whopping Harisen

This weapon has a 50% chance to deal 1 tile of knockback to the target when an attack connects.<br/>Since most monsters lack a ranged attack, this effect lets you avoid damage pretty often.<br/>Resonates with Zabuton, which grants a 10% chance to inflict Laughing status.

##### Disguising Staff

The effect only lasts 8 turns, but that's a good amount of time when it comes to distracting the boss.<br/>Swing it at one of the regular ninjas, and depending on Seki's positioning, she'll focus on the boss.

##### Peach Staff

Instantly defeats the monster hit by the magic bullet, transforming them into a Peach Bun.<br/>Some of the best targets to use Peach Staff on include:

- Hat Urchin - Steal staves from enemies (ability always succeeds).
- Bowboy or Crossbowboy - Shoot arrows at a wall to collect lots of arrows.
- Karakuroid - Create Poison Arrow Traps or other useful traps, Swift status.
    - Beware of Water Ninja's ability while you have Morphed status.
- Death Reaper - Permanent Swift status while you have Morphed status.
    - Beware of Water Ninja's ability while you have Morphed status.
- Masked Samurai - Revive as Ghost Warrior if you happen to be defeated.
- Tengu Monk - Press ZL to give yourself Swift status whenever you'd like.
- N'dulu - Press ZL to give yourself Hiding status whenever you'd like.

##### Blurry Incense

Can be used to restrict a Field Knave family monster's ability to locate items in rooms.<br/>It can also be helpful during the boss fight since it masks your location from regular ninjas,<br/>but keep in mind that the boss can overwrite the incense effect with its own incense.

##### Cashing Pot

Thrown Gitan deals damage equal to 20% of the bag's value, and this also applies to the boss.<br/>Items like Gazer Shield, Walrus Stopper, and Froggo Stopper can be inserted to create high value bags,<br/>and there isn't a downside since the monsters those shields counter don't appear in this dungeon.<br/>You'll need a total of 3400 Gitan worth of Gitan bags to defeat the boss using this strategy.

### Farming Techniques

Field Knaves appear starting on 8F, and Curse Girls from 10F, so aim to finish farming items on 7F.

#### Nigiri Morph Factory (1-3F)

Nigiri Baby (1-3F) appears, so have it turn unneeded items into Large Onigiri if you find a shield.<br/>If you find rocks or arrows, turn individual rocks or arrows into onigiri instead of the entire stack.<br/>You can do so by stepping on single rocks or arrows and exchanging them with inventory items.<br/>It's worth trying Nigiri Morph Factory even if you don't find a shield - walk around in a large room.<br/>Increasing max fullness to 150+ activates Sumo status, which is a massive help here.

#### Grilled Onigiri (2-9F)

Firepuff (2-4F)'s special attack deals fire damage, so onigiri in your inventory will become grilled.<br/>Grilled Onigiri replenishes 75 fullness and restores 40 HP - Not bad as an early game healing item.<br/>Don't worry too much if you step on a Rotting Trap, since Fire Ninja D (5-9F) can also grill onigiri.

#### Hat Urchin Bun (2-4F)

If you find a Peach Staff, wave it at a Hat Urchin (2-4F) and become a Hat Urchin to steal staves.<br/>Unlike Swordsman Bun or Pot Knave Bun, Hat Urchin Bun's ability has a 100% success rate,<br/>so you'll quickly be able to fill up your inventory with staves.

#### Wooden Arrows / Iron Arrows (7-9F)

Bowboy (7-9F) appears alongside Earth Ninja D (5-9F), so use a sand pillar to collect arrows.<br/>Bowboy always uses its special attack when you're lined up and within range of its arrows.<br/>If desired, have Bowboy defeat an enemy to level up into a Crossbowboy for Iron Arrows instead.

#### Poison Arrows (6-12F)

Karakuroid (6-12F) has the ability to create a random trap, which includes Poison Arrow Trap.<br/>The easiest method is to throw a Rock or Porky's Rock onto the trap to safely activate the trap.<br/>If you don't have rocks, have Karakuroid create traps along the wall, then throw an item at the wall<br/>so that the item lands on the Poison Arrow Trap. Karakuroid Bun lets you create traps, too.<br/>※ Karakuroid has 20 attack, so don't expect to tank hits like you were able to in Shiren 5.

#### Curse Girl / Cursister Hunting (13F)

Curse Girl and Masked Samurai are the only 2 monsters who appear on 13F.<br/>Curse Girl (65 HP, 28 atk) gives 180 exp, and Cursister (115 HP, 38 atk) gives 380 exp.<br/>Masked Samurai (47 HP, 18 atk) gives 48 exp, and Raging Samurai (100 HP, 45 atk) gives 400 exp.<br/>It can be worthwhile to linger and hunt some of these monsters to level up if you have lots of arrows,<br/>but pay close attention to how much damage you're taking, and weigh the risks of missed attacks.<br/>Don't use up all of your Poison Arrows on this floor, though.

# Floor Guide

Generally you'll want to finish performing item farming techniques by the end of 7F.<br/>Players often burn through more resources than they gain if they explore floors from 10F onwards.<br/>Remember that you don't need a full inventory to defeat the boss, you just need a few good items.<br/>If you see a shop, try to visit it if possible even if doing so consumes some resources.

### 1-4F

Monsters aren't too tough aside from Firepuff (2-4F) dealing a fixed 10 damage with its flame.<br/>Take your time and check every room for items, and attempt to identify any unidentified items.<br/>Death Reaper (22 HP, 6 atk) has Swift 1 action speed, so don't try to retreat if your HP is low.

Have Nigiri Baby (17 HP, 8 atk) turn projectiles and unneeded items into Large Onigiri on 1-3F.<br/>Then depending on playstyle, either eat the onigiri to raise max fullness to 150+ for Sumo status,<br/>or grill the onigiri using Firepuff to stock up on Grilled Onigiri which heals 40 HP when eaten.

If you get lucky and find a Peach Staff, wave it at a Hat Urchin to obtain lots of staves.<br/>Disguising Staff is fantastic during the boss fight in particular.

### 5-9F

The monster table swaps to mostly elemental ninjas, and enemy attack power is notably higher.<br/>Karakuroid (40 HP, 20 atk) has Swift 1 speed, and Hell Reaper (45 HP, 12 atk) has Swift 2 speed,<br/>so things can get difficult from 6F if you haven't found a decent shield yet - use items if needed.

Collect Poison Arrows from Poison Arrow Traps using Karakuroid on 6-7F if possible.<br/>Bowboy (45 HP, 17 atk) also appears between 7-9F, making it possible to collect Wooden Arrows.<br/>An easy method to collect arrows is to use a sand pillar created by an Earth Ninja D.

Field Knave (50 HP, 15 atk) appears between 8-11F, making it harder to claim items on the ground.<br/>If you found a Sealing Staff and Blank Scroll, consider throwing an Eradication Scroll at Field Knave.

Fire Ninja D no longer appears after 9F, so grill any Rotten Onigiri before continuing to 10F.

### 10-15F

The elemental ninjas, Hell Reaper, and Bowboy all exit the monster table.<br/>Replacements include Masked Samurai (47 HP, 18 atk, 18 def) and Curse Girl (65 HP, 28 atk, 28 def).<br/>Curse Girl has the stats of a monster closer to Serpentcoil Island 15F, so you'll want to use arrows.<br/>Mixers don't appear in this dungeon, so you don't have much reason to worry about her curse.

Don't let Ghost Samurai roam around, as higher level monsters here are quite strong.<br/>Lv2 stats: Cursister (115 HP, 38 atk), Steamroid (100 HP, 45 atk), Raging Samurai (100 HP, 45 atk).<br/>That said, some players like to hunt Curse Girl (180 exp) or Cursister (380 exp) on 13F using arrows,<br/>since this floor doesn't have dark hallways.

13F is usually the final safe-ish floor, so if you decide to linger, try to reach Lv20 for faster HP regen.<br/>Beyond 13F, enemies like Swordsman, Nigiri Morph, Polygon Shaka, and Pot Knave begin to appear,<br/>so you often risk losing more resources than you gain if you try to check rooms or linger.

### 14-16F

These 3 floors feature Pot Knave (65 HP, 35 atk, 25 def), who throws Weeds into pots in your inventory.<br/>If you're adjacent in a room, shoot an arrow at a wall and step away to have them focus on the item.<br/>Despite having a more troublesome ability, they also have higher attack power than Curse Girl.<br/>Of course, these monsters will also transform items on the ground into Weeds.

### 16-20F

Curse Girl and Masked Samurai exit the monster table, but Pot Knave is still around on 16F.<br/>Polygon Shaka (70 HP, 34 atk), Swordsman (77 HP, 30 atk), and N'dulu (70 HP, 40 atk) appear.<br/>Polygon Shaka (16-21F) decreases Fullness by 5, and warps in front of Shiren when in a room.<br/>Swordsman (15-21F) disarms your equipped shield, sending it flying 10 tiles behind you.

N'dulu (16-19F) disguises itself as an item, and does a surprise attack when you use the item.<br/>Disguised N'dulu in your inventory will automatically be identified when you advance floors.<br/>Avoid relying on items you found on the current floor if you're in danger.

Metalhead (66 HP, 30 atk) also appears starting on 17F, and can attack 2 tiles ahead.<br/>In addition, a Behemoth Gate has a chance of being generated on the floor between 17-19F.<br/>Don't try to make the gate vanish for an item drop unless you have a Monster-find Bracelet.

### 21-24F

The hardest floor range, featuring Lv2 monks and ninjas alongside other monsters.<br/>Exploring is very risky, so it's best to rush to the stairs unless you lack items for the boss.<br/>Lv2 monks have stats in the range of 106\~130 HP, 40\~47 attack, and 35\~41 defense.<br/>Lv2 ninjas have stats in the range of 70\~85 HP, 37\~45 attack (Earth is 21 atk), and 21\~28 defense.

Skull Wizard (88 HP, 35 atk, 24 def) inflicts Confused status from a distance among other effects.<br/>Nigiri Morph (88 HP, 35 atk, 30 def) transforms an inventory item into Large Onigiri, and never fails.<br/>Remember that you can one-shot Nigiri Morph by throwing an onigiri at it, as long as it hits.<br/>You shouldn't need onigiri at this point unless you're making use of Sumo status.

Insert scrolls into Preservation Pots to avoid Water Ninja C turning them into Wet Scrolls.<br/>Water Ninja C appears during the boss fight too, so don't remove scrolls from pots on 24F.

### Boss

<div class="dungeonPageImage">
  <img src="../images/areas/other/madara.jpg"/>
</div>

Madara (666 HP, 37 atk, 34 def) is a Normal type monster, so he has no weaknesses.<br/>Status conditions can be inflicted, but they get cured in roughly 2\~4 turns depending on the status.<br/>Sanctuary Scroll and Knockback Staff <span class="redText">do not</span> work, Paralyzing Staff and Narrow-escape Staff <span class="blueText">do</span> work.<br/>The boss has the ability to activate an incense effect in response to various actions the player takes.<br/>Example: Shoot a Poison Arrow at Madara → Madara spreads the effect of Evasive Incense.

Special attacks:

- Breathe Smoke - Activates an incense effect based on the player's actions.
    - Evasive - Player deals damage to Madara with an arrow.
    - Defensive - Player uses an Aggressive Incense.
    - Reflective - Player uses a staff or scroll against Madara.
- Jump - Madara leaps away from the player.
    - He seems to use this special more often when his HP gets low.
- Smoke Bomb - Madara creates a clone (Roughly 60 HP?).
    - He seems to use this special more often when his HP gets low.
    - 2\~3 arrows should be enough to defeat the clone.
- Howl - Summons 3 ninjas from the floor's monster table.

Other notes:

- The fight begins with 6 other Lv2 ninjas on the field.
    - Disguising Staff lasts 8 turns and is the best option for distracting all enemies on the field.
    - Narrow-escape Staff, Paralyzing Staff, or Peach Staff can be used to quickly disable underlings.
        - Other decent options include Fixer Scroll, Confusion Scroll, or Blurry Incense.
- The player is joined by companion Seki (Lv20), who is an immense help.
    - Seki has swift speed and focuses on Madara, and deals roughly 40 damage per hit.
    - She takes 1 step back after a normal attack, making her very reliable in 1 vs 1 situations.
- Swift Grass, Power-up Grass, and Invincible Grass are fantastic.
    - Don't bother using Aggressive Incense, since it'll likely just get overwritten.
- Empathetic Staff can be used to supplement damage if your damage output is low.
